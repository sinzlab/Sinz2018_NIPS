# Stimulus domain transfer in recurrent models for large scale cortical population prediction on video (Code)
Code to reproduce results of the NIPS 2018 paper: "Stimulus domain transfer in recurrent models for large scale cortical population prediction on video". 

## Requirements

* `docker`, `nvidia-docker` (version 1), and `nvidia-docker-compose`. You can easily run it with `nvidia-docker` version 2. In that case have a look at the `nvidia-docker-compose.yml.jinja` and extract the options for the `notebook` service to start the container. 
* [GIN](https://web.gin.g-node.org/G-Node/Info/wiki/GinCli#quickstart) along with `git` and `git-annex` to download the data.

## Quickstart

Go to a folder of you choice and type the following commands in a [shell of your choice](https://fishshell.com/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sinzlab/Sinz2018_NIPS.git
cd Sinz2018_NIPS

# get the data
gin get cajal/Sinz2018_NIPS_data # might take a while; fast internet recommended

# create a file with DB credentials
echo "DJ_HOST=134.2.118.234" >> .env
echo "DJ_USER=public_access" >> .env
echo "DJ_PASS=ffeWQ@7O" >> .env

# create docker container (possibly you need sudo)
nvidia-docker-compose -t docker-compose.yml.jinja build notebook0
```

Then you can start the container via

```bash
nvidia-docker-compose -t docker-compose.yml.jinja up notebook0
```

Now you should be able to access the jupyter notebooks via `YOURCOMPUTER:2018` in the browser. 

## Custom Database Server

You can also run the notebook with your own database server. In that case you need to insert the content of `Sinz2018_NIPS_data/dbdump/nips2018.sql` into your own database and change the `DJ_HOST, DJ_USER, DJ_PASS` parameters accordingly.
